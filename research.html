  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>I am investigating the dynamics of ice rises and ice rumples in coastal Antarctica. These features act to regulate the flow of ice into the Southern Ocean. Under a changing climate, the geometry and ice flow dynamics of ice rises and ice rumples change, causing a change in their buttressing effect.<p>
  <h2>Tools</h2>
  <p>In order to investigate ice rises and ice rumples in an idealised sense, we use the finite element model Elmer/Ice.</p>
