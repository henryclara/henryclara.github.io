	<p>I am a PhD student in ice sheet modelling at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology and at the University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany.</p>
  <p>I became interested in Earth system modelling while studying applied mathematics at the University of St Andrews, UK. My interests are in geophysical fluid dynamics and dynamical systems using both numerical and theoretical methods.</p>
  <p>When I am not working, you can find me playing the fiddle, hiking or running.</p>
